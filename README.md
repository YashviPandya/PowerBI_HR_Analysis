# 📊 Human Resource Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on exploring HR data to uncover insights about employee attrition, satisfaction, department-wise performance, and key HR metrics. It simulates a real-world business case where HR leadership needs a dashboard to identify trends and make informed retention and recruitment decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze employee attrition trends
- Identify key drivers of job satisfaction and resignation
- Segment workforce data by department, job roles, and satisfaction levels
- Create an interactive dashboard for HR decision-makers

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for dashboarding and data modeling
- **Excel** for initial data cleaning
- **DAX** for calculated measures
- Dataset: Kaggle (HR Analytics / IBM HR Data)

## 📈 Key Visuals
- Attrition Rate by Department
- Monthly Hiring vs Attrition Trends
- Employee Satisfaction vs Performance Rating
- Heatmaps of Tenure vs Attrition
- Dynamic Filters (Department, Age Group, Gender, Marital Status)

## 💡 Business Insights
- R&D had the highest attrition (28%) — major concern for technical continuity
- Employees with low job satisfaction and low performance ratings showed 3x higher attrition
- Employees aged 25–35 showed peak resignation rate — possibly career change seekers
- Sales had stable performance but high workload (indicated by avg overtime)

## 🧠 Recommendations
- Conduct retention interviews in R&D department
- Design incentives for high-performing but dissatisfied employees
- Focus employee engagement for younger employees with under 2 years tenure

## 📂 Files
